# RandomWalk
A Random Walk on 2D Plane

This program is an experiment in learning how to transfer the results of code onto a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. 
It is based off coinflips on a number line (from -10 to 10), in which starting at zero,
landing a flip on heads will move forward by one and a landing on tails will move backwards by one. 
This also keeps track of the number of trials in a given experiment.
The results of each trail will be stored in a dictionary, in which at the end, will create a spreadsheet and puts
the result of the trails in.
